## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Jaya**, a student in **Computer Science and Engineering (AI & ML)**. I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems—especially at the intersection of **Web Development**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Healthcare**, and **Research**.

My areas of interest include:

* 🧠 **AI in Healthcare** — using machine learning for diagnostics, disease prediction, and mental health analysis
* 🌐 **Web Development** — building interactive, user-centric dashboards and data-driven applications
* 🔬 **Research & Innovation** — exploring data to uncover patterns, publish meaningful insights, and contribute to academic growth

I believe in learning by doing.
Feel free to connect or collaborate!
